spip is a Discord bot written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).

This bot is not intended to be a public bot (for now), so if you want to use it you will have to make it work yourself (you can still contact me on Discord (julien#6394) if you need help or informations about **spip**).

PRs are welcome !
